# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Textbook

This comprehensive textbook bridges digital AI knowledge to physical robotics for intermediate AI/software developers. You'll learn to build systems that combine artificial intelligence with physical hardware, focusing on humanoid robotics applications.

### What You'll Learn

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: The robotic nervous system that connects all components
- **Simulation Environments**: Creating digital twins for testing and development
- **NVIDIA Isaac Integration**: Advanced AI-robotics frameworks
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: How robots perceive, understand, and act

### Prerequisites

Before starting this textbook, you should have:
- Intermediate knowledge of Python programming
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Experience with version control systems
- Access to a machine capable of running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Learning Approach

This textbook follows a hands-on approach where theory is immediately followed by practical implementation. Each concept includes:
- Clear explanations with analogies
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Code examples tested in Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble
- Troubleshooting guides
- Self-assessment questions

### Textbook Structure

The content is organized into 4 progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Core concepts of ROS 2 architecture, packages, and URDF
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation and sensor simulation
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, and Nav2
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Voice commands, LLM integration, and capstone project

Each module builds upon previous knowledge, ensuring a smooth learning curve from foundational concepts to advanced implementations.

### How to Use This Textbook

- **Linear Learning**: Follow the modules in order for progressive skill building
- **Modular Access**: Jump to specific modules if you have prerequisite knowledge
- **Hands-on Practice**: Execute all code examples in your environment
- **Self-Assessment**: Complete exercises and review questions at the end of each chapter
- **Reference Material**: Use appendices for troubleshooting and setup guides

### Technical Requirements

This textbook targets Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill. All code examples are tested in this environment to ensure reliability and consistency. While some concepts may apply to other platforms, the specific implementations and commands are tailored for this target environment.

### Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts before advancing to more complex topics. Each chapter includes learning objectives, prerequisites, and expected outcomes to guide your study.
