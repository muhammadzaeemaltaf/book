# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system connecting all components of a robotic system. You'll learn the fundamental concepts that enable different parts of a robot to communicate and work together.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of distributed systems
- Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with message passing concepts

### Estimated Duration

2-3 hours

## Introduction

ROS 2 provides the foundation for all robotic applications. Think of it as the nervous system of a robot - it allows sensors to communicate with controllers, enables coordination between different software components, and provides the infrastructure for complex robotic behaviors.

In this module, we'll explore how ROS 2 enables different parts of a robot to work together seamlessly, creating a unified system from many individual components.
