# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to the foundation of robotic systems! This module introduces Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that connects all components of a robotic system. Think of ROS 2 as the nervous system of a robot—it enables sensors, processors, controllers, and actuators to communicate and coordinate seamlessly.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its core concepts
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces effectively
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions for robotic communication
- Describe robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Build your first ROS 2 package with publishers and subscribers

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed the Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installed on your development machine
- Familiarity with Linux command line operations

### Estimated Duration

This module requires approximately 8-10 hours of study and hands-on practice.

## Chapter Breakdown

This module contains four progressive chapters:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts
Learn the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture, including nodes, topics, services, and parameters. Understand how ROS 2 provides the communication backbone for robotic systems.

### Chapter 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services in Depth
Deep dive into the primary communication mechanisms in ROS 2. Implement publisher-subscriber patterns and service-client interactions with practical examples.

### Chapter 3: Workspaces, Packages, and Launch Files
Master the development workflow with ROS 2 workspaces and packages. Create and build your first ROS 2 package, and learn to orchestrate complex systems with launch files.

### Chapter 4: URDF - The Robot's DNA
Understand how to describe robot structure and kinematics using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). Create robot models that can be simulated and controlled in various environments.

## Why This Module Matters

ROS 2 serves as the foundational layer for almost all modern robotics development. Whether you're working with industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, or humanoid systems, ROS 2 provides the standardized interfaces and tools that make complex robotic systems manageable. Understanding ROS 2 deeply is essential for anyone serious about robotics development.

This module establishes the communication patterns and architectural understanding that will be crucial as you advance to more complex topics in subsequent modules. The concepts learned here will directly apply to simulation, AI integration, and vision-language-action systems.

## Learning Path

We recommend studying this module in sequence:
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand the architectural concepts
2. Practice with Chapter 2's communication examples
3. Build your own packages in Chapter 3
4. Apply everything in Chapter 4 with URDF modeling

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so don't skip ahead. The hands-on exercises are designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical implementation.
