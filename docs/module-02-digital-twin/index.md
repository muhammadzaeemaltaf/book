# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module covers simulation environments that serve as digital twins of physical robots. You'll learn how to create virtual environments where robots can be tested safely before deployment to physical hardware.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand physics simulation concepts
- Create and configure simulation environments
- Integrate sensors in simulation
- Connect simulation to physical robot concepts

### Prerequisites

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Experience with 3D visualization

### Estimated Duration

2-3 hours

## Introduction

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical robot that allows for testing, validation, and development without risk to expensive hardware. In this module, we'll explore how simulation bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robotics, enabling safer and more efficient development processes.

Understanding the connection between simulated and physical environments is crucial for developing robust robotic systems that can operate effectively in the real world.
