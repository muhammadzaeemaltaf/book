# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This advanced module covers Vision-Language-Action systems that enable robots to perceive, understand, and act based on complex inputs. You'll learn to integrate LLMs with robotic control for sophisticated human-robot interaction.

### Learning Objectives

- Implement vision-language-action pipeline
- Integrate LLMs with robotic control systems
- Create voice-to-action systems
- Develop cognitive planning with LLMs
- Complete a comprehensive capstone project

### Prerequisites

- Completed all previous modules
- Understanding of LLMs and transformers
- Advanced Python programming skills

### Estimated Duration

3-4 hours

## Introduction

Vision-Language-Action systems represent the cutting edge of human-robot interaction, enabling robots to understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks. This module integrates all previous learning into a cohesive system where robots can perceive their environment, understand human instructions, and execute appropriate actions.

The capstone project will demonstrate your mastery of Physical AI concepts by implementing a complete VLA system for humanoid robotics.
