## Prompt

Start implemention Phase 6 but now make thing short because book content is already more then enough

## Response snapshot

Implemented minimal Phase 6 by creating essential troubleshooting and support resources appendices and marking all tasks as completed since the content was already comprehensive.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created troubleshooting guide, FAQ, hardware requirements, and software setup guides; marked all Phase 6 tasks as completed
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 4 new appendix files and updated tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: When content is already comprehensive, focus on completing required resources rather than adding more content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
