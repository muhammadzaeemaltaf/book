## Prompt

start implementing Phase 1, use mcp to fetch Docusaurus latest documentation

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Phase 1: Project Setup and Initialization for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project.

## Completed Tasks:
- [X] [T001] Initialize Docusaurus project with required dependencies for textbook
- [X] [T002] Configure docusaurus.config.js with textbook structure and navigation
- [X] [T003] Set up sidebars.js with module and chapter organization
- [X] [T004] Configure package.json with build and validation scripts
- [X] [T005] [P] Create basic directory structure for modules (docs/, static/, etc.)

## Implementation Details:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Created directory structure: docs/intro, docs/module-01-ros2, docs/module-02-digital-twin, docs/module-03-isaac, docs/module-04-vla, docs/appendices, static/img, static/code, src/components
   - Installed Docusaurus core dependencies: @docusaurus/core, @docusaurus/preset-classic, @mdx-js/react
   - Configured package.json with Docusaurus scripts and dependencies

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - Created docusaurus.config.js with textbook-specific settings, GitHub Pages deployment config, and proper navigation
   - Created sidebars.js with autogenerated sidebar structure
   - Created custom CSS file for styling
   - Updated package.json with build and validation scripts

3. **Content Structure**:
   - Created intro.md with textbook introduction
   - Created module overview pages for all 4 modules:
     * Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
     * Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
     * Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
     * Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
   - Created appendices index page

4. **Static Assets**:
   - Created placeholder files for favicon, logo, and social card
   - Ensured static directory structure is properly set up

5. **Docusaurus Documentation**:
   - Used MCP to fetch latest Docusaurus documentation
   - Applied best practices for configuration and project structure
   - Ensured compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment

The project successfully builds with `npx docusaurus build`, generating static files in the build directory. All Phase 1 tasks have been completed and marked as [X] in the tasks.md file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Docusaurus project setup for Physical AI textbook with proper structure and configuration
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: 14 files created/modified across config, content, and assets
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase 2 - Foundational Content Structure
- 🧠 Reflection: Project structure follows Docusaurus best practices and textbook requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial configuration issues with static files and broken links resolved
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All Phase 1 tasks completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 2 implementation with user story content creation
